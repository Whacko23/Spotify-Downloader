# Spotify-Downloader

- This little python script allows downloading songs from Spotify by looking for them on YouTube just by entering the song's HTTP link or its URI in an MP3 format.

- You can also download a song by entering its artist and song name.

- Downloading a song using spotify link will automatically fix its meta-tags and add a nice a albumart to the song.

That's how your Music library will look like!

```
import eyed3
import os
for x in os.listdir('/home/pi/Spotify-Downloader/Music/'):
  if x.endswith('.mp3'):
    audiofile = eyed3.load('/home/pi/Spotify-Downloader/Music/' + x)
    audiofile.tag.save(version=(2,3,0))
```

Feel free to report issues and fork this repository!

## Installation & Usage:

#### Debian, Ubuntu, Linux & Mac:
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/Ritiek/Spotify-Downloader
cd Spotify-Downloader
sudo pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
You'll also need to install avconv:

`sudo apt-get install libav-tools`

Use `sudo python spotdl.py` to launch the script.

#### Windows:

Assuming you have python (2.7.12 or higher, python 3 is not supported currently) already installed..

- Download Libav-Tools for windows: https://builds.libav.org/windows/release-gpl/libav-x86_64-w64-mingw32-11.7.7z. Copy all the contents of bin folder (of avconv) to Scripts folder (in your python's installation directory)

- Download the zip file of this repository and extract its contents in your python's installation folder as well.

Shift+right-click on empty area and open cmd and type:

`"Scripts/pip.exe" install -U -r requirements.txt`

Now to run the script type:

`python.exe spotdl.py`

(you can create a batch file shortcut to run the script just by double-click anytime)

[NOTE: spotdl.py must be in the same folder as python.exe]

## Instructions for Downloading Songs:

- First launch the script using the above command as mentioned for your OS.

- If you want to skip the conversion process and meta-tags, run the script by passing `-n` or `--no-convert` option:
`sudo python spotdl.py -n` or `python.exe spotdl.py -n` depending on your OS.
[NOTE: This option will also skip meta-tags as .m4a cannot hold meta-tags]

- Use `-h` option to see full list of supported options.

#### Downloading by Name:

For example:

- We want to download Hello by Adele, simply run the script and type `adele hello`.

- The script will automatically look for the best matching song and download it in the folder `Music/` placed in your current directory.

- It will now convert the song to an mp3.

- Now, if we want to check it out the lyrics of that song, just type `lyrics` in the script and it should print out the lyrics for any last downloaded song.

- Okay, lets play the song now. Just type `play` in the script.

#### Downloading by Spotify Link:

For example:

- We want to download the same song (i.e: Hello by Adele) but using Spotify Link this time that looks like  `http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7`, you can copy it from your Spotify desktop or mobile app by right clicking or long tap on the song and copy HTTP link.

- Now simply paste this link after running the script, it should download Hello by Adele.

- Just like before, it will again convert the song to an mp3.

- Now, that we have used a Spotify link to download the song, the script will automatically fix the meta-tags and add an album-art to the song.

- Similarly, we can now check out its lyrics or play it.

- Just type `exit` to exit out of the script.

#### What if we want to download multiple songs at once?

For example:

- We want to download Hello by Adele, The Nights by Avicci and 21 Guns by Green Day just using a single command.

Also this time we have the Spotify link only for Hello by Adele but not for other two songs.

No problem!

- Just make a list.txt by running the following commands:

```
cd
cd Spotify-Downloader
sudo nano list.txt
```
(if you are on windows, just edit `list.txt` - i.e `C:\Python27\list.txt`)

add all the songs you want to download, in our case it is:

```
https://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7
the nights avicci
21 guns green day
```

- Now just run the script and type ```list```, it will automatically start downloading the songs you provided in `list.txt`.

- You can stop downloading songs by hitting `ctrl+c`, the script will automatically resume from the song where you stopped it the next time you want to download the songs using `list`.

- To download all songs in your playlist, just select all the songs `ctrl+a` in Spotify desktop app, copy them `ctrl+c` and paste `ctrl+v` in `list.txt`.

## Brief info on Commands:
```
• play - will play the last song downloaded using mplayer
• list - downloads songs from list.txt
• lyrics - will print out the lyrics for last downloaded song
• exit - exit the script
```
